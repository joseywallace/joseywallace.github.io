Hi, I'm Joseph Wallace; An Engineer, Scientist, and lifelong learner. I currently work at Intel where I specialize in technology development and optimization for next-gen electron beam lithography processes. Prior to this I was designing and conducting pulsed ion beam experiments at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to probe the lifetime of radiation generated defects in materials, while working on a PhD in Nuclear Engineering at Texas A&M University.

I currently work at Intel, as a Senior Process Engineer, pushing the limits of the electron beam lithography processes used to create photomask. This work requires a 'full-stack' data science approach as follows:

Receiving the benefits of content is a certain something. Be that as it may, it's so substantially less demanding once you begin conveying all the more successfully. The profitable content thought isn't just about bragging your item's capacities and general worth or your organization's achievements. You should concentrate less on advertising how awesome your item is and rather concentrate on indicating how valuable it is. This is a client focused approach as it concentrates on their issues and your answer for them. Making yourself fundamental is critical.
