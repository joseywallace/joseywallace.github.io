Hi, I'm Joseph Wallace; An Engineer, Scientist, and lifelong learner. I currently work at Intel where I specialize in technology development and optimization for next-gen electron beam lithography processes. Prior to this I was designing and conducting pulsed ion beam experiments at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to probe the lifetime of radiation generated defects in materials, while working on a PhD in Nuclear Engineering at Texas A&M University.

## Engineer
<div class="box">
  <p>
I currently work at Intel, as a Senior Process Engineer, pushing the limits of the electron beam lithography processes used to create photomask. This work requires a data science approach as follows:
      <!-- Lists -->
		<ol>
			<li>Identify parameters of interest and implement equipment to monitor </li>
			<li>Gather and reshape data from tool and setup SQL to upload to database</li>
			<li>Create script to download data and perform data cleaning</li>
			<li>Perform exploratory data analysis to identify correlations</li>
			<li>Reduce sources of process-line correlation by adjusting tool operation</li>
			<li>Design a machine learning model to account for remaining sources of correlation</li>
		</ol>

By combining the Statistical Process Control (SPC) approach with Machine Learning (ML) I was able to signifcantly reduce process variation that led to improved yield and tool uptime.

## Scientist
<div class="box">
  <p>
As a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I designed and conducted pulsed ion beam experiments to probe the lifetime of radiation generated defects in silicon. Irradiations were performed on an Van der Graaf 4 MV particle accelerator. The results of these experiments found the lifetime of defects on the scale of ~0.1 - 100 microseconds, whereas previous estimates ranged from 100s of seconds to nanoseconds (an astonishishing 12 orders of magnitude!!). The results of these experiments resulted in ~12 publications (See Publications).

## Student
<div class="box">
  <p>
At Texas A&M I graduated with a PhD in Nuclear Engineering in 2016 and did a double degree in Nuclear Engineering and Physics in undergrad. However, since finishing my PhD I have continued learning through online platforms such as Coursera and Edx. In the coming Spring, I plan to start classes in Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Science Computer Science (OMSCS). The flexibility of online courses has put the power of learning back into the students hands by eliminating the obstacels such as fixed time schedules and high cost.
